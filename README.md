### This is a test project for Front-End Test Automation July 2024 Course @ SoftUni

## Overview
This repository demonstrates how to automate testing of Android mobile applications using **Appium** and **Page Object Model (POM)**.

## 1. "Summator" Page Object Model (POM)
 **Summator** is a simple calculator Android application. The app allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations.

### 1.1 Automated Testing Scenario

The testing scenario involves the following steps:

1. **Open the Summator App.**
2. **Perform tests with both valid and invalid inputs:**
   - For valid inputs, verify the calculation results are correct.
   - For invalid inputs, ensure that an "error" message is displayed in the result field.

### 1.2 Configure Appium Inspector

To run tests, follow these steps to configure Appium Inspector:

1. **Start the Appium Server.**  
   If you're using the web version, start it with `--allow-cors` enabled.
   
2. **Start your Android Virtual Device (AVD).**
   
3. **Install the application** on your AVD by dragging and dropping the `.apk` file into the emulator.

4. **Set up Appium Inspector:**
   - Provide the host and port of your Appium server (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:4723`).
   - Add the desired capabilities:
     - `automationName`: `UiAutomator2`
     - `platformName`: Android (use `appium driver list` to get the value)
     - `platformVersion`: Get the Android version using `adb shell getprop ro.build.version.release`.
     - `deviceName`: Use `adb devices` to find the connected device name.
     - `app`: Path to the `.apk` file on your computer.
### 1.3 Identify Element IDs

Using Appium Inspector, retrieve the IDs of the elements you need for testing, such as text fields, buttons, etc. For example:
- Click on a field, and the ID will be displayed in the "Selected Element" panel.

### 1.4 Refactor Tests from Non-POM to POM

- **Identify Elements and Actions:**  
  Locate elements like `field1`, `field2`, `buttonCalc`, and `result`, as well as actions like clearing fields, sending keys, and clicking the calculate button.

- **Create Page Object Classes:**  
  Move the identified elements and actions into a new class following the POM pattern.

- **Update the Test Class:**  
  In the test class, instantiate the `SummatorPOM` object in the setup method and replace direct element interactions with calls to POM methods.

## 2. ColorNote App

The **ColorNote** app is a simple notepad application that allows users to create, edit, and delete notes. We will create automated tests for various scenarios in this app.

### 2.1 Automated Testing Scenarios

1. **Creating a New Note:**
   - Open the app and skip the tutorial.
   - Add a new note with a title and content.
   - Verify the note is successfully created.

2. **Editing a Note:**
   - Open the app and skip the tutorial.
   - Add a new note, then edit its content.
   - Verify the note has been updated.

3. **Deleting a Note:**
   - Open the app and skip the tutorial.
   - Add a new note, then delete it.
   - Verify the note is successfully deleted.

### 2.2 Configuring Appium Inspector for ColorNote

1. **Start Appium Server and your AVD.**
   
2. **Install the app** on the AVD if not already installed.

3. **Configure Appium Inspector:**
   - Use the same host and port (`http://127.0.0.1:4723`).
   - Add the desired capabilities, including:
     - `"appium:autoGrantPermissions": "true"` to automatically handle permission dialogs.

### 2.3 Recording with Appium Inspector

To record steps for a scenario, follow these steps:

1. **Open the ColorNote App** and skip the tutorial.
   
2. **Add a new note:**
   - Click the "+" or "Add Note" button.
   - Select "Text" to create a text note.
   - Type the content of the note, and confirm with the "Tick" symbol.
   
3. **Pause the recording** and view the elements and actions in the "Recorder" tab.  
   You can view boilerplate code generated by the Inspector as a reference, but itâ€™s essential to refactor the code to follow best practices.

### 2.4 Writing Tests for ColorNote

Create tests in **Visual Studio** using NUnit and Appium:

- **Install the Appium.WebDriver package** from the NuGet Package Manager.
- **Define your test class:**  
  Use `[TestFixture]` to mark the class as a test suite and configure the setup and teardown methods using `[OneTimeSetUp]` and `[OneTimeTearDown]`.

#### Sample Test Scenarios:

- **Test to Create a Note:**
  - Add a new note and verify it is displayed on the main screen.

- **Test to Edit a Note:**
  - Modify an existing note and verify the changes.

- **Test to Delete a Note:**
  - Delete a note and verify it is removed from the app.
